Once the user has filled out the form and saved/submitted, the results will be posted to the appropriate board. You can change the look of this page by creating a Custom Template Function.<br /><br /><span class="bbc_u"><strong>Custom Template Functions:</strong></span><br />This is a feature allows you to create your own custom template function for each form, to do this we suggest that you make a duplicate of the &quot;form_template_example()&quot; function within the &#039;CustomForm.template.php&#039; file. You can then use the documentation from that function to see how information is passed to it by the Mod, allowing you to change it for your purposes.<br /><br />Please remember that you have to name the new template function in this format &quot;form_template_{Custom Template Name}&quot;, and you will have to put the correct value from &quot;{Custom Template Name}&quot; into the &quot;Custom Template Function&quot; setting for the form that you wish to use you new template. Further explanation for custom templates can be found in the &#039;CustomForm.template.php&#039;.<br /><br />Three Custom Templates are included with the mod; example, left, and center. Enter the appropriate name into the &quot;Custom Template Function&quot; field, click save, then go to your form and see how the look of your form changes.<br /><br /><strong><span class="bbc_u">CAPTCHA Visual Verification:</span></strong><br />Visual verification often referred to as CAPTCHA and used by SMF for registration and posting, is included in the mod to help prevent against bots from using forms as a way to post your forum. Visual verification requires that the user type letters or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen in order for a form to submit correctly.<br /><br />By default all forms require visual verification when being filled out by guests and can not be turned off. Alternatively registered members will also be required to use visual verification based on existing settings in SMF.<br /><br />To access verification settings in for <strong>SMF 1.1.x:</strong> go to Admin =&gt; Registration =&gt; Settings or index.php?action=regcenter;sa=settings<br /><br />To access verification settings in for <strong>SMF 2.x:</strong> go to Admin =&gt; Configuration =&gt; Security and Moderation =&gt; Anti-Spam or ?action=admin;area=securitysettings;sa=spam.<br /><br />Further explanation of a settings functionality can be found by clicking on the [?] help button next to each setting.<br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Tutorial:</span></span><br /><br />Balance Games has provided a step by step tutorial on how to use the Custom Form Mod.<br /><a href="http://smf.balancegames.org/mods/forms/tutorial" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">http://smf.balancegames.org/mods/forms/tutorial</a><br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Compatibility:</span></span><br /><br />While it is highly recommended that you update to the most current versions of SMF... <br /><strong>CustomFormMod_v1.7_SMF1.1.x:</strong> Supports most versions of SMF 1.1.<br /><strong>CustomFormMod_v1.7_SMF2.x:</strong> Supports most SMF 2.0 versions after 2.0 RC2.<br /><br /><span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color"><span style="font-size: 14pt;" class="bbc_size">Version Changes:</span></span><br /><strong>V1.7:</strong><br />Updated: Due to conflicts with mod_security, the url syntax &quot;index.php?action=form;id=#&quot; has been changed to, &quot;index.php?action=form;n=#&quot; Thanks to <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=17752" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Galatea</a> and <a href="http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=265135" class="bbc_link new_win" target="_blank">Arantor</a> for the fix.<br />Added: All posts created by a form are now attributed to a users post count.
